# Motivation-Poster-Website
The purpose of the website is to test my css skills that were learned and finish the tasks that are being asked. Some of the tasks are having the main h1 text set to the google font Regular Libre Baskerville Font from Google Fonts, having the text white, the background color black, and having the text being centered.
